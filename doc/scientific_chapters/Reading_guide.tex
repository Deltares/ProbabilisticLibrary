This document is a manual for the \probLib. This document leads the user through a probabilistic analysis using the \probLib. 

This document uses a number of examples. Some of the examples are part of the Probabilistic Toolkit. They can be found in "$\text{Documents\textbackslash Deltares\textbackslash Probabilistic Toolkit}$" or, using the open dialog in the Probabilistic Toolkit, in the Probabilistic Toolkit section. 

This document is split in a number of parts. They are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduction: Contains some general information about the \probLib.
	\item Scientific Background: Explains how calculations are performed.
