(prototype) C++ version Probabilistic Library

Improvements with respect to the Fortran code:
1) FORM and DS are now thread save
   (gives new possibilities for parallel computing)
2) Using CMake with almost no platform dependencies
3) Now with python wrapper
4) Tests with ctest / Google test (integration with Github actions)
5) Identical results, but cleaner code and better tested
   e.g. rootfinder for DS
6) Works with Microsoft compiler and GNU compiler
