# Probabilistic Library

This is the repository of the Probabilistic Library of Deltares.

The library provides a set of routines that enable reliability analysis of a component or a system of components.

__Calculation techniques for a single component:__
- FORM
- Crude Monte Carlo
- Directional Sampling
- Importance Sampling
- Adaptive Importance Sampling
- Numerical Integration
- Hybrid calculation techniques

__System analysis:__ parallel system, series system.

__Distribution functions:__ deterministic, uniform, normal, (shifted) lognormal, beta, (shifted) exponential, Gumbel, Rayleigh, (conditional) Weibull, Pareto.

__Correlation models:__ Gaussian correlation model.
