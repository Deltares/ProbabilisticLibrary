Probabilistic Suite Community
=============================

Welcome to the **Probabilistic Suite Community**.
This site is the central hub for users and developers of the **Deltares Probabilistic Suite**, a framework for uncertainty, reliability, and risk-based analyses.

The Probabilistic Suite consists of a high-performance computational core, Python libraries for automation, and the **Probabilistic Toolkit (PTK)** graphical user interface.
This community site focuses on **open examples, tutorials, documentation, and knowledge sharing**, with a strong emphasis on Python-based workflows.


----

What is the Probabilistic Suite?
--------------------------------

The Probabilistic Suite enables quantitative analysis of uncertainty and risk in engineering and scientific models.

It consists of the following components:

- **Probabilistic Library (C++)**
  High-performance routines for reliability, uncertainty, and sensitivity analyses.

- **Python Library**
  A Python interface to the probabilistic kernel, enabling scripting, automation, and integration with other tools.

- **Probabilistic Toolkit (PTK)**
  A graphical user interface for setting up, executing, and visualizing probabilistic analyses.

Together, these components allow users to move seamlessly from exploratory analysis to automated workflows and large-scale studies.
